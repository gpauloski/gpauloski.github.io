## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="static/headshot.jpg">

Hello there.
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.
I work with Dr. Ian Foster and Dr. Kyle Chard as a part of [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/).
I recently completed my Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin where I worked at the Texas Advanced Computing Center.

Check out my recent projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/gpauloski).
You can contact me at jgpauloski (at) uchicago (dot) edu.

## Research Interest

My interest lie at the intersection of high-performance computing and machine learning.
In particular, my research is focused on systems for enabling efficient and scalable machine learning training in large, distributed environments.
I am also interested in various optimization methods that can enable large-batch training.
