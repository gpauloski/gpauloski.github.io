## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="static/headshot.jpg">

Hello there.
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.
I work with Dr. Ian Foster and Dr. Kyle Chard as a part of [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/).
I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin where I worked at the Texas Advanced Computing Center.

Check out my recent projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/gpauloski).
You can contact me at jgpauloski (at) uchicago (dot) edu.

## Research Interest

I am interested in systems that enable large-scale machine learning and scientific applications.
On the machine learning side, I am working to improve the efficiency and scalablity of distributed training via hybrid-parallel and higher-order optimization methods.
I am also working on new approaches to managing the flow of data in scientific workflows that span multiple heterogeuous compute systems.
