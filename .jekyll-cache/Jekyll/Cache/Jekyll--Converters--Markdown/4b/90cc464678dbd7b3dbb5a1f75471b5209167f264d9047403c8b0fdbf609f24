<p><img class="profile-picture" src="static/headshot.jpg" /></p>

<p>Hello there.
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.
I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin.
I work with Dr. Ian Foster and Dr. Kyle Chard, and I am a part of <a href="https://labs.globus.org/">Globus Labs</a>.</p>

<p>Check out my recent projects on <a href="https://github.com/gpauloski">GitHub</a>.
You can contact me at jgpauloski (at) uchicago (dot) edu.</p>

<h2 id="research-interest">Research Interest</h2>

<p>My interest lie at the intersection of high-performance computing and machine learning.
In particular, my research is focused on systems for enabling efficient and scalable machine learning training in large, distributed environments.
I am also interested in various optimization methods that can enable large-batch training.</p>
