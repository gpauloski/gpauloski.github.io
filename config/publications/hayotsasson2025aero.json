    "tldr": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for new data infrastructure, as epidemiologists and public health workers raced to harness rapidly evolving data, analytics, and infrastructure in support of cross-sector investigations. To meet this need, we developed AERO, an automated research and data sharing platform for continuous, distributed, and multi-disciplinary collaboration. AERO supports the automatic ingestion, validation, and transformation of monitored data into a form suitable for analysis; the automated execution of analyses on this data; and the sharing of data among different entities. AERO leverages capabilities provided by the Globus platform and GitHub for automation, distributed execution, data sharing, and authentication.",
