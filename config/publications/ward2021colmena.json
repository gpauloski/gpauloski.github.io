    "tldr": "We present Colmena, an open-source Python framework that allows users to steer massive computational campaigns by providing just the implementations of individual tasks plus the logic used to choose which tasks to execute when. We describe the design of Colmena and illustrate its capabilities by applying it to electrolyte design, where it both scales to 65536 CPUs and accelerates the discovery rate for high-performance molecules by a factor of 100 over unguided searches.",
