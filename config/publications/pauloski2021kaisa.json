    "tldr": "We present KAISA, a K-FAC-enabled, Adaptable, Improved, and ScAlable second-order optimizer framework that adapts the memory footprint, communication, and computation given specific models and hardware to improve performance and increase scalability. Compared to the original optimizers, KAISA converges 18.1â€”36.3% faster across applications with the same global batch size.",
